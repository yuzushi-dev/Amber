## Major Architecture Refactoring

This release represents a complete clean architecture transformation of the Amber platform. The codebase has been restructured following Domain-Driven Design principles with clear separation of concerns.

### Clean Architecture Implementation

- **Layered Structure**: Each core domain now follows the pattern: `domain` → `application` → `infrastructure`
- **Dependency Inversion**: Core modules no longer import from API/platform layers
- **Composition Root**: Centralized dependency wiring with lazy settings provider
- **Unit of Work Pattern**: Explicit tenant scoping via PostgreSQL session variables with single transaction boundary management

### Domains Restructured

| Domain     | Description                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ingestion  | Document processing with extraction strategies (fallback, local, API-based), chunking logic, and connectors |
| Retrieval  | Query parsing, structured queries, hybrid search with sparse/dense embeddings, result fusion and re-ranking |
| Generation | Chat services with memory management (Redis/Postgres), context builder, and intelligence strategies         |
| Graph      | Entity extraction, communities, maintenance, and Neo4j integration                                          |
| Admin Ops  | Metrics, quality, tuning, evaluation, observability, and usage tracking                                     |
| Tenants    | Tenant isolation core with comprehensive verification scripts                                               |

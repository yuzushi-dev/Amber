        "ideal_context": "The system combines Milvus for vector search and Neo4j for graph-based retrieval, using a hybrid fusion approach with RRF.",
        "ideal_answer": "The core components are Milvus (vector store), Neo4j (graph database), and a hybrid retrieval service that uses Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to combine results."

        "query": "How does the system handle multi-hop queries?",
        "ideal_context": "Multi-hop queries are handled via a Beam Search traversal on the Neo4j knowledge graph starting from extracted entities.",
        "ideal_answer": "It uses a GraphTraversalService that implements a Beam Search algorithm to explore entities and relationships in Neo4j across multiple hops."
